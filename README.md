# WPF with Dependency Injection
A very very very very very simple .NET 6 WPF project that uses dependency injection as an example of the following services:
- `IFactory<T>` service for creating view-models.
- `IConfiguration` and `IOptions<T>` services for application options.
- `ILogger<T>` service with [NLog](https://nlog-project.org/) for application wide logging.
